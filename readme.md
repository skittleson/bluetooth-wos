> > Bluetooth "Wall of Sheep" is a lightweight Python application that scans for nearby Bluetooth devices and displays them in a live-updating, interactive board. It's ideal for demonstrating Bluetooth visibility and presence tracking in real-time.


## ✨ Demo

## ✅ Features

### 🔍 Core Features
- Live discovery of nearby Bluetooth devices
- Interactive “Wall of Sheep” display with metadata
- Company identification via public device listing
- Real-time CSV export of scanned device data

### 📏 Device Intelligence
- Estimates distance using RSSI and TX Power
- Highlights persistent devices ("stick around")
- Removes transient devices to handle address randomization
- Detects and hides device MAC addresses for privacy

### 🔧 Configurable Behavior
- Adjustable timeout for inactive devices
- Toggle address visibility


## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Linux or macOS (Bluetooth support)
- `pip`, `uv`, and `pyinstaller`


```bash
pip install uv
uv venv
uv pip sync requirements.txt
uv run index.py
```

## Development

`python -m  pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')`

### 🛠️ Build Portable 

`pyinstaller index.py -F -n bluetooth-wos`

## 🛣️ Roadmap
 
 - [ ] Resolve services by name
 - [x] Estimates distance from transmitter and receiver of a device given ONLY RSSI if know distance values are present.
 - [ ] Configurable columns
 - [ ] Fingerprint devices that keep changing MAC addresses
 - [ ] Show adv data
 - [ ] Interactive way to go into service data
 - [ ] Resolve common service->characteristics such as temp/humidity
 - [ ] attempt to keep same indexes of current devices
 - [x] Load spinner on first load. It's boring to see nothing in a table
 - [ ] no coloring option
